We use Thymeleaf to bind the UI with backend, but Bootstrap is only styling.
We are using Bootstrap to get some fancy CSS classes and some JavaScript files for some basic UI functionalities.

If you want to use Thymeleaf, you are adding this to your HTML file:
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">


But if you want to use Bootstrap you need to add these between the <head> tags in your HTML file:
<link th:href="@{/css/bootstrap-4.1.3-dist/css/bootstrap.min.css}"/>
<script th:src="@{/js/jquery-3.3.1.min.js}"></script>


But you can add Bootstrap like above, if you downloaded Bootstrap classes into your local computer. But if you don't download those Bootstrap classes, and still want to be able to use them, you need to add these between the <head> tags in your HTML file:
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">
<!-- JavaScript Bundle with Popper -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>


This will bring all Bootstrap CSS classes and JavaScript files into your view.
